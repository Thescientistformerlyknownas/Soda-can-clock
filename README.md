# Soda-can-clock

This project shows the code for an analog clock with an Arduino pro mini, a DS3231 real time clock module and a Nokia 5110 LCD display.
The code is converting the digital signal from the real time clock module into an analog format using mathematics, especially trigonometric
functions like sine and cosine. The text, pictures and film can be found here: https://www.instructables.com/Soda-Can-Clock-Using-Arduino-Pro-Mini-DS3231-and-N/

The code for the Arduino was previously explained here: hhttps://www.instructables.com/Analog-Clock-Using-Math-Arduino-Pro-Mini-DS3231-an/s
However, some improvements were made concerning power consumption an therefore the code was updated and uploaded here.
With a 2900 mAh battery the clock is running for 4 month.
